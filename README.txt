If you want build project you should download SFML SDK from:

https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/

and configure with description:

https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php

because properly build depends on Visual Studio and SFML version.
You must also copy lib from SFML file "C:\SFML-2.5.1\bin" to place where file .exe is (arkanoid\x64\Debug).
